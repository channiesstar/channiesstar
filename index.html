            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Channies_star but you can call me Holly :3 ! I LOVE
                writing songs and k-pop. I have been collecting albums and photocards since December 2023 and now
                have over 80+ albums and 200+ photocards hehe... Other than k-pop and collecting, I love nature and animals;
                I own a German Shepherd named Apollo and he is such a baby hehe; here is a photo of him:
